    "# Homework 4 - Getting to know your customers\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the Banking sector has dabbled into plenty of Data Science applications. The latter includes topics such as Fraud detection, risk modelling for investment, personalized marketing, managing customer data and customer segmentation, among others. The latter is a crucial topic for a bank since they can offer their products more accurately and tailor-made depending on their clients' characteristics and how probable they will consume more services from the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you and your team have been hired by a bank to get to know their customers. In other words, you will implement hashing and clustering techniques to extract relevant information and highlights from those clients and their transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## VERY VERY IMPORTANT!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. !!! Read the entire homework before coding anything!!! \\\n",
    "2. My solution is not better than yours, and yours is not better than mine. A data-driven analysis does not have a unique way of solving a problem. For this reason, it is crucial (necessary and mandatory) that you describe any single decision you take and all the steps you follow. \\\n",
    "3. Once performed any exercise, comments about the obtained results are mandatory. We are not always explicit about where to focus your comments, but we will always want brief sentences about your discoveries and decisions.\n",

    "### 1. Finding Similar Costumers\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies nowadays are implementing product suggestions to provide users with things they are likely to buy. The process often starts by finding similar behaviours among consumers; for this task, we will focus on this part in the specific.\n",
    "Here you will implement an algorithm to find the most similar match to a consumer given his bank account information. In particular, you will implement your version of the [LSH algorithm](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/building-recommendation-engine-locality-sensitive-hashing-lsh-python/) that takes as input information about a consumer and finds people similar to the one in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Set up the data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To start working download the [banking dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/bank-customer-segmentation) on Kaggle.\n",
    "2. For the sake of this first part, not all columns are necessary since comparing each field single handedly can be quite time-expensive. Then, carefully read the linked guide above and try to understand which features will be appropriate for this task (An heads up: some users have more than one transaction record, make sure to handle them all). Once you have finished, project a version of the dataset to work with."
